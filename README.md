#Magnetic soft matter simulations

The project contains simulations of soft matter with magnetic particles.

FORC folder contains simulation of the first order reversal curve experiment.
Magnetically *hard* particles simulated by the Stoner-Wohlfarth model
Magnetically *soft* particles obey the Froehlich-Kennelly law
